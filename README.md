# Compromised Container (root)

A container bundled with a number of networking and Docker/K8 tools. Used mainly to help review the security of Kubernetes clusters and environments. Inspired by the containers built by [smarticu5](https://github.com/smarticu5/Container-review-admin) and [raesene](https://github.com/raesene/alpine-containertools).
